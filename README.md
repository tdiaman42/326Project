# 326Project
#This program will allow users to access data from the NBA Draft Combine from years 2009 to 2016. The data icludes every player invited to the combine, the year they were drafted (if applicable), and all of their measurements and scores. With the search of a certain player, they can access different information like the year they were drafted and at what pick they were drafted. If they are curious about a certain measurement, not only will the program list the desired measurements but it will also display a scatter graph made with matplotlib that shows where they rank amongst all the other participants.
